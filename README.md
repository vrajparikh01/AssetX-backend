## üß© API Endpoints
The backend exposes various API endpoints for interacting with the AssetX platform. Below are some of the key endpoints:
- `/v1/contract/rwa-token` - Call RWA token contract functions
- `/v1/contract/sto`: Creating Wrapped ERC20 tokens and other getters
- `/v1/contract/uniswap`: Uniswap V2 function calls for pool creation, adding liquidity and swaps.
- `/v1/contract/launchpad`: Launchpad contract functions for project creation, investment, and fund withdrawal.
- `/v1/pinata`: Pinata IPFS upload and fetch endpoints

## Pinata Integration

The backend integrates with Pinata for IPFS storage. It uses the Pinata APIs to upload and retrieve files. 

Main functions:
1. Upload files to IPFS via Pinata
2. Retrieve files from IPFS via Pinata gateway
3. Manage Pinata API keys and configurations
